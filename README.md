# Hospital-Dataset-SQL-Project-

# SQL project on hospital data includes several important aspects:

The main purpose of this project is to show case hospital management by performing key queries. I have taken the data from kaggle.The project focuses on a hospital database that stores essential details such as:
Hospital Name
Location
Department
Number of Doctors
Number of Patients
Admission & Discharge Dates
Medical Expenses
Steps Taken in Your Project

# Database Creation
Some major steps taken by me are given below:-
1.Created a database named Hospital_data
2.Defined a hospital table with relevant columns to store hospital-related data.
3.Data Import & Exploration
4.Queried all records from the hospital table using SELECT * FROM hospital;

# Key Queries and Analysis 

1.Total number of patients across all hospitals (SUM(patients_count))
2.Average number of doctors in each hospital (AVG(doctors_count))
3.Top 3 hospital departments with the highest patient count (ORDER BY patients_count DESC LIMIT 3)
4.Hospital with the highest medical expenses (MAX(medical_expenses))
